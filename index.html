                    <p>
                        We bought an old house, my boyfriend and I. He's in charge of the "new" 
                        construction â€“ converting the kitchen in to the master bedroom for instance, 
                        while I'm on wallpaper removal duty. The previous owner papered EVERY wall and 
                        CEILING! Removing it is brutal, but oddly satisfying. The best feeling is getting 
                        a long peel, similar to your skin when you're peeling from a sunburn. I don't know 
                        about you but I kinda make a game of peeling, on the hunt for the longest piece before 
                        it rips.Under a corner section of paper in every room is a personâ€™s name and a date. 
                        Curiosity got the best of me one night when I Googled one of the names and discovered 
                        the person was actually a missing person, the missing date matching the date under the 
                        wallpaper! The next day, I made a list of all the names and dates. Sure enough each name 
                        was for a missing person with dates to match. We notified the police who naturally sent 
                        out the crime scene team. I overhead one tech say "yup, it's human." Human? What's human? 
                        "Ma'am, where is the material you removed from the walls already? This isn't wallpaper you 
                        were removing."

                    <p>
                        He awoke to the huge, insect like creatures looming over his bed and screamed his lungs 
                        out. They hastily left the room and he stayed up all night, shaking and wondering if it 
                        had been a dream.The next morning, there was a tap on the door. Gathering his courage, 
                        he opened it to see one of them gently place a plate filled with fried breakfast on the 
                        floor, then retreat to a safe distance. Bewildered, he accepted the gift. The creatures 
                        chittered excitedly.This happened every day for weeks. At first he was worried they were 
                        fattening him up, but after a particularly greasy breakfast left him clutching his chest 
                        from heartburn, they were replaced with fresh fruit. As well as cooking, they poured hot 
                        steamy baths for him and even tucked him in when he went to bed. It was bizarre.One night, 
                        he awoke to gunshots and screaming. He raced downstairs to find a decapitated burglar being 
                        devoured by the insects. He was sickened, but disposed of the remains as best he could. He 
                        knew they had just been protecting him.One morning the creatures wouldn't let him leave his 
                        room. He lay down, confused but trusting as they ushered him back into bed. Whatever their 
                        motives, they weren't going to hurt him.Hours later a burning pain spread throughout his body. 
                        It felt like his stomach was filled with razor wire. The insects chittered as he spasmed and 
                        moaned. It was only when he felt a terrible squirming feeling beneath his skin that he realised 
                        the insects hadn't been protecting him. They had been protecting their young.

                    <h3>Aura</h3>
                    <p>
                        Everyone loves the first day of school, right? New year, new classes, new friends. It's a day 
                        full of potential and hope, before all the dreary depressions of reality show up to ruin all 
                        the fun.I like the first day of school for a different reason, though. You see, I have a sort 
                        of power. When I look at people, I can...sense a sort of aura around them. A colored outline 
                        based on how long that person has to live. Most everyone I meet around my age is surrounded by 
                        a solid green hue, which means they have plenty of time left.A fair amount of them have a 
                        yellow-orangish tinge to their auras, which tends to mean a car crash or some other tragedy. 
                        Anything that takes people "before their time" as they say.The real fun is when the auras 
                        venture into the red end of the spectrum, though. Every now and again I'll see someone who's 
                        basically a walking stoplight. Those are the ones who get murdered or kill themselves. It's 
                        such a rush to see them and know their time is numbered.With that in mind, I always get to 
                        class very early so I can scout out my classmates' fates. The first kid who walked in was 
                        basically radiating red. I chuckled to myself. Too damn bad, bro. But as people kept walking 
                        in, they all had the same intense glow. I finally caught a glimpse of my rose-tinted reflection 
                        in the window, but I was too stunned to move. Our professor stepped in and locked the door, his 
                        aura a sickening shade of green.
